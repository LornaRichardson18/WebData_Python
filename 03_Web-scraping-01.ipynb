    "## Why is this useful?\n",
    "There are many reasons why you would want to scrape data. Some examples are:\n",
    "- Scrape pages of newspapers to get information around important historical events (e.g. elections, major reforms, armed conflicts)\n",
    "- Compare prices of different products by scraping the pages\n",
    "- Find the cheapest flight tickets for your dream holidays!\n",
    "\n",
    "##¬†üìë Illustrative example\n",
    "Imagine that one day, you find yourself thinking:\n",
    "> Gee, I wonder who the five most popular mathematicians are?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this is to use [Wikipedia's xTools](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/XTools) to measure the popularity of a mathematician by equating popularity and page views. For example, look at the page on [Henri Poincar√©](https://xtools.wmflabs.org/articleinfo/en.wikipedia.org/Henri_Poincar√©). There you can see that Poincar√©‚Äôs pageviews for the last 60 days are, as of December 2017, around 32,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you Google for ‚Äúfamous mathematicians‚Äù and find [this resource](http://www.fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm) which lists 100 names. Now you have both a page listing mathematician‚Äôs names and you have a website that provides information about how ‚Äúpopular‚Äù that mathematician is. Now what?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Python and web scraping come in. Web scraping is about downloading structured data from the web, selecting some of that data, and passing along what you selected to another process."

    "We first need to understand some basics on how the web works and how we can access the data in the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP\n",
    "HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol used for communication between distributed and multi-layered systems on the web. The foundation of the web as we know today (the world wide web) uses HTTP as the main data communication protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP functions as a request-response protocol, or in an active fashion, meaning that one end issues a \"request\" and the other end receives the request and responds with a \"response\". This is a generic and more of a high-level explanation, but just have in mind that the response can be pretty much anything that is parseable (a JSON document, XML, HTML, an integer number, a URL...you name it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic example of how this work is when you browse the web. Usually speaking, there is a server (or multiple) hosting the website you are accessing that will be in charge of receiving the requests and responding with the website pages (serving them to you). In this case your browser will be known as the \"client\" and the server, well, it's known as the \"server\" \n",

    "- HTML: contain the main content of the page\n",
    "- CSS : the styling (makes the page look snazzy)\n",

    "### Verbs / Methods\n",
    "These define the action that should be performed on the the host:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP GET: Requests a representation of the specified resource (Document, HTML Page, Picture, JSON, XML...). Using the GET method should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP POST: Requests that the server accept the data enclosed in it's request body as a new resource to be persisted on it's end. The data POSTed might be for instance a new user that registered in your website, a new message on an instant messaging app, a comment on a thread etc. Usually speaking, it's something that the server will store on it's end for later consumption, processing or usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP HEAD: The HEAD request is identical to the GET request, but instead of receiving the full payload of the response, it receives only meta-information about the server (also known as the response headers). This is useful for understanding what is running on the server (or how it reacts to different requests), without having to tranport the entire content of a standard response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP PUT: Similar to the POST request, but this one suplies an URI (identifier) that should be used by the server to persist the object transported by the PUT request. The catch here is that if an object with the same URI already exists on the server side, it should be overwritten by the one received (this operation is also known as UPSERT or Merge operation. If the record does not exist, it will be inserted, otherwise it will be updated).\n",
    "\n",

    "- HTTP OPTIONS: Requests the HTTP methods and actions supported by the server for one specific URL\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The Status Codes are the way the server can tell the client what happened with the request it issued. Have you ever tried to access a site and saw the classic \"404 - Not Found\" screen ? Well, it turns out that \"404\" is the Status Code that represents the Not Found status.\n",

Because HTML isn't a programming language, it isn't nearly as complex as Python.\n",
