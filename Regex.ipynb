    "## What is a regular expression?\n",
    "A regular expression (regex) is a string of characters defining a pattern that should be searched for in a block of text. A regex can be constructed to allow multiple possible matches, while restricting other possibilities, making the approach considerably more powerful and precise than the simple 'CTRL+F' or 'Find/Replace' operations that you might be familiar with from word processing/web browser software. It's also possible to use regular expressions to specify parts of the search pattern that will be kept in the replacement string of a substitution operation.\n",
